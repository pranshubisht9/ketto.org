        <h1>What is Crowdfunding?</h1>
        <p>In its simplest form, Crowdfunding is a practice of giving monetary funds to overcome specific social,
            cultural, or economic hurdles individuals face in their daily lives.</p>

            <h2>So how does Crowdfunding work On Ketto?</h2>
            <p>Let us assume an individual, unfortunately, meets with an accident on the road. His medical expenses and
                hospital bills start piling up. Now he needs ₹5 Lakh to pay his expensive medical bills. Fortunately,
                his best friend signed up on Ketto’s crowdfunding platform, completed the process of submitting valid
                documents needed for verification. In a few minutes, he created a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds
                for his friend’s medical expenses. Now, this campaign can be shared with all his near and dear ones
                through WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and E-mail. In a matter of few minutes, funds start
                coming in to support the financial needs of the injured friend.</p>
